Brain-Stroke-Prediction
Python code for brain stroke detector

Software:
•	Anaconda,  Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm

Language Used:
•	Python 3.8

Techniques:

•	Python-For Programming Logic

•	Application:-Used in application for GUI

•	Python :- Provides machine learning process


     Methodology:

•	To proceed with the implementation, different datasets were considered . Out of all the existing datasets, an appropriate dataset was collected for model building.
•	After collecting the dataset, It lies in preparing the dataset to make the data more clear and easily understood by the machine. This step is called as Data preprocessing.
•	It includes handling of missing values, handling imbalanced data and performing label encoding that are specific for this particular dataset.
•	For model building, preprocesed dataset along with machine learning algorithms are required. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification algorithm, Random Forest Classification algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, Support Vector algorithm are used.
